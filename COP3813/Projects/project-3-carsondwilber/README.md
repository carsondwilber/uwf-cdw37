# Project 3

This is the starter code for project 3. You'll need to put your name and info in the `package.json` file. You'll notice that there is no Pug or other extraneous code here because this is simply an API.

This starter code shows how to use the [apikey](https://www.npmjs.com/package/apikey) library to secure the app. In this case the api key is `test`, and it needs to be passed in via the HTTP headers in order to work.

This code also shows how to use the [zipcodes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zipcodes) library to determine the distance between two zip codes and obtain all zip codes within a certain mile radius. This should get you started using the zipcodes library in this project.
